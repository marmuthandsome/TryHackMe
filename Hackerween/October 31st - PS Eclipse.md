**Medium, Blue Team**

You are a SOC Analyst for an MSSP (Managed Security Service Provider). A customer sent an email asking to investigate the events that occurred in Keegan's machine. The client noted that the machine is operational, but some files have a weird file extension. The client is worried that there was a ransomware attempt on Keegan's device. Your manager has tasked you to check the events in Splunk to determine what happened.
