**Medium, Blue Team**

Scenario: You are a SOC Analyst for an MSSP (Managed Security Service Provider) company called TryNotHackMe.

A customer sent an email asking for an analyst to investigate the events that occurred on Keegan's machine on Monday, May 16th, 2022. The client noted that the machine is operational, but some files have a weird file extension. The client is worried that there was a ransomware attempt on Keegan's device. 

Your manager has tasked you to check the events in Splunk to determine what occurred in Keegan's device. 

Happy Hunting!
