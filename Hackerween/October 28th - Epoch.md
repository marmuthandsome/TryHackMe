**Red Team Lab**

Be honest, you have always wanted an online tool that could help you convert UNIX dates and timestampsâ€¦ and this new online date converter tool is totally secure...right?! In this challenge, you must figure out how the web application works, convert UNIX dates, and exploit the web application to find the flags!

Why printenv: The printenv command in Linux provides you with the ability to view all or a part of the environment.
