### Who is Hackerween for?

Our 5 challenges have incrementing difficulty. The first two days are beginner-friendly, and then we're amping up the difficulty for more technical users. This is a great way to trial your skills - but remember - we have guided labs to enable you to upskill and prepare for more technical topics where you need it.

### What are TryHackMe challenges all about?

In 2022, TryHackMe released challenges - search by type > challenges on our [Hacktivities page](https://tryhackme.com/hacktivities?tab=search). Every other Friday, we launch a brand new challenge lab that aims to exercise your skills in various blue and red topics, including SSRF, Kubernetes, phishing, reversing and bypassing authentication methods, and so. much. more!

The purpose of our challenge labs is to give you a space where you can practice and test your skills without being hand-held. We have guided content ready for you whenever you need it, so if you decide you need to brush up on topics, you can jump back into a guided lab to learn pre-challenge. The reason for these challenges is to give you a space to hack (and defend) away on your own!

So, whilst weâ€™re bringing you a bunch of epic challenges every fortnight, Hackerween is all about giving you a range of challenges in one, celebrating everything cyber security and upskilling in your field - woohoo!
